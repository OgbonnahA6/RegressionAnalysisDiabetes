# Summary of Regression Analysis: Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF) and BMI
The regression analysis investigates the relationship between BMI (Body Mass Index) and Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF), where BMI serves as the predictor and DPF is the dependent variable.

## Key Findings:
-	**1. Direction and Magnitude of Relationship:**
  - The coefficient for BMI is **0.0066488**, indicating a positive relationship between BMI and DPF.
  - For every 1-unit increase in BMI, the DPF is expected to increase by approximately 0.0066. While the relationship is statistically significant, the small coefficient suggests a modest practical impact.
    
- **2.	Statistical Significance:**
  - The p-value for BMI **(< 0.0001)** confirms that the relationship is statistically significant, meaning the association between BMI and DPF is unlikely to be due to chance.
  - The intercept is also statistically significant (p < 0.0001), representing the baseline DPF when BMI is zero, though this value holds limited real-world relevance.
    
- **3.	Model Performance:**
  - The R-squared value of **0.0216** indicates that BMI explains only **2.16%** of the variance in DPF, highlighting the need for additional predictors to explain DPF variability better.
  - The standard error of **0.3199** shows moderate variability in the modelâ€™s predictions, indicating some level of imprecision.
    
- **4.	Practical Implications:**
  - While BMI is a significant predictor of DPF, **the low R-squared value suggests it has limited explanatory power**. Other variables like age, glucose, or insulin may provide a more comprehensive understanding of DPF.
